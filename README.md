# Swiggy-Data-Analysis-using-SQL-Project
A comprehensive SQL project with an in-depth analysis of a Swiggy-like restaurant and order dataset. It uses JOINs, CTEs, Window Functions, and aggregation to uncover insights into revenue, customer behavior, and top-selling menu items.

Swiggy Data Analysis using SQL (Advanced Queries) üçΩÔ∏è
This project demonstrates the power of SQL for data analysis and reporting using a simulated Swiggy-like dataset. The goal is to extract key business insights on restaurant performance, customer spending patterns, and the most popular menu items.

üõ†Ô∏è Key SQL Topics & Techniques

This project utilizes the following advanced SQL concepts:

- JOINs (INNER JOIN): Establishing complex relationships between the restaurants, orders, customers, menu_items, and order_items tables.

- Aggregation and Grouping: Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, and item quantities.

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Using CTEs like restaurant_order_totals, total_avg, and live_customer to manage complex logic and improve query readability.

- Window Functions:

- Ranking: Applying RANK() to rank customers based on their total spending.

- Running Totals: Using SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY ...) to show the cumulative sum of customer spending.

- Averages: Calculating the average order value for each customer with AVG() OVER (PARTITION BY ...).

üîë Key Insights Achieved

- Financial Health: Per-restaurant and per-city revenue analysis.

- Customer Segmentation: Identifying high-value customers through average spend and total spend ranking.

- Product Performance: Determining the total quantity and popularity of menu items.

- Operational Efficiency: Calculating metrics like average order value per customer and per restaurant.

üéØ Business Questions Addressed

In this SQL file, we successfully answered the following business questions:

1. What is the total revenue generated by each restaurant?

2. What are the top 3 most frequently ordered menu items?

3. Which city has the highest total revenue?

4. What is the average order value for each customer?

5. How do you display a running total of each customer's spending?
